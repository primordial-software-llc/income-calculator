## About
The net income calculator allows you to define your income, set a budget and monitor all of your finances in one place.

### Budget
The budget feature allows you to define monthly, weekly and bi weekly income and expenses. You have the ability to specify the account the income will be deposited into or expenses will be withdrawn from to serve as a reminder for you.

## Privacy and Security

Your bank data will never be viewed by anyone except for yourself. Here are the steps we take to guard your bank data.

- All connections are SSL encrypted with a certificate from a well known certificate authority (Amazon Web Services) from your computer to our servers
- Authentication uses [Amazon Web Services Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) with multi-factor authentication
- Bank data is transiently delivered and never stored on our servers. The only data related to your bank held on our servers is an access token to connect to your bank which you can delete at anytime and permanently delete from our servers
- Our software never has direct access to your bank login username and password. The bank integration is built with Plaid to ensure your bank's username and password are only seen by our trusted third party [Plaid](https://plaid.com/company/)

### Data Storage
Your data is held in 2 places
1. The data you entered when creating an account is held in plain-text with no encryption.
2. Budget, manually entered financial data and bank access tokens are held in Amazon's Dynamo DB and encrypted at rest with Amazon's Key Management Service (KMS)
