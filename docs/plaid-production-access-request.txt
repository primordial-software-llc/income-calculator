My goal is to build low-cost financial services products for individuals and small businesses. My product will have two main components: budgeting and asset tracking.

My goal is to build low-cost financial services products for individuals and small businesses. My product will have two main components: budgeting and asset tracking.

BUDGETING
I intend to draw people in through the budgeting software which I have made as simple as possible to get people to build a monthly budget. Once a budget is setup I allow people to view their budget on a calendar for any given month. A budget can become more detailed by specifying accounts that income is deposited into and expenses are withdrawn from. If accounts are specified for monthly income and expenses you can see the totals for the month by account.

ASSET TRACKING
Once people have made a budget and stuck to it, then they have a need for the asset tracking component. The asset tracking portion of the software is meant to ensure funds exist for the current month and help a person create a well rounded balance sheet. The product's purpose is to allow people to not have to know or think about accounting. The product will guide people to describe their assets and liabilities then build a balance sheet with varying levels of depth that can be read by someone with little to no accounting experience.

How will each product be used
==========================================
BALANCE
I need access to account balances to help build a persons balance sheet. I want to show all of a persons bank and credit card balances in one place.

TRANSACTIONS
I need access to transaction to show all of a persons transactions across many banks in one place so they can review them for legitimacy. I may use transactions to show budgeted and un-budgeted income and expenses.
