# Budget
Enter your biweekly, weekly and monthly income and expenses. Then view your income and expenses on the calendar.

Expenses are Red

Income Is Green

I need something besides color for people who are color blind or using a screen reader. An icon, text, a negative symbol or parentheses would suffice.
