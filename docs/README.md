# Justification of Discretionary Expenses

A discretionary expense, in this context, is one where the consumer has control of the cost of goods consumed.

This isn't like paying your insurance off all at once versus paying it off in increments.
In this scenario there is a calculated gain, time value of many, which is realized as interest.

An example of a discretionary expense is food. I can live off of bread, the very food that the ancient Egyptians used to build the greatest structures ever known to man for about $2 a day. Beyond $2 a day, food is discretionary.

Beginning to be luxurious, I would want to supplement with protein and fat. So for another $4 I could have a piece of tilapia and for pennies I could have olive oil. Now I would be eating like a wealthy greek (well maybe if I had some wine, but that's not nutritious and would fall under the category of entertainment and be completely discretionary - when having a constant supply of clean water).

So anything beyond $6.50 ($2 bread, $4 fish, $.50 olive oil) a day is absolute luxury. I don't want to hear shit otherwise, because people did far more with less in past times and it's a completely balanced meal hitting the macro nutritents. I'm in more danger of not sticking to this budget than I am from staying strict to the diet and contracting something like scurvy, because I can't afford an orange.

## USDA Cost of Food

[USDA Cost of Food June 2016](http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/CostofFoodMay2016.pdf)

For the month of May the USDA shows $42.90 for a Male aged 19-50, per week. This breaks down to about $6.12 a day.

Me and the USDA are on agreement that I **need** to spend between $6-$7 a day if I want a chance at a nutritious diet every day.

Now that's the lower end and I want to intake fruits and vegetables so I don't contract things like scurvy and hit Daily Reference Intake (DRI) values. For an additional $2 a day, $1 for fruit and $1 for vegetables, I can meet micronutrient dietary needs.
 
 My calculations show this then to be $8.50 a day to hit both macro and micro nutrients. A week this is $59.50.

This puts me right near the 'Low-cost' plan. The USDA has $55.40 listed per week for this plan.

I would also want a variety of meats as an **unjustified luxury**. Say another $3 per day to upgrade from something like tilapia to a quality beef. Now that puts me at $11.50. For a week this is $80.50. This now jumps me right past the `Moderate-cost plan` into the `Liberal plan`, which the USDA has a weekly amount as  $85.60. Rightly so, that means I could eat steak every day. This is where projections and calculators come into play. I really want to say a few days out of the week I will upgrade my meats from the base. You really can't eat steak everyday. I've tried, your teeth start to hurt!
