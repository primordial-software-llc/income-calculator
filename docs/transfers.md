# Transfers

All transfers enter a pending state where the transfer can be reviewed. Press complete to update the amounts on the balance sheet and remove the transfer or cancel to delete the transfer and leave the balance sheet unchanged.

*Equities show pending transfers with a current and available balance. I need to move this functionality to cash.* This is important, because some assets like stocks or bonds can be known weeks in advance and the person needs to know how much money is expected to be withdrawn from the account and how much is available to perform more future purchases. For example when treasury bonds are purchased they are done weeks in advance and a person will typically purchase many different treasury bonds so they mature on different dates.
