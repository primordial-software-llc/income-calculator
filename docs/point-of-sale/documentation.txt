Property Point of Sale

A. Taking a payment on a previous sale.
	1. A new payment will be created causing the customers balance to decrease.
	2. The payment should be applied manually in quickbooks at a later time.

B. Making a sale, but not taking a payment.
	1. A new invoice will be created with no payment causing the customers balance to increase.

C. Making a sale and taking a payment.
	1. When a payment is made greater than a new sale, two payments will be made. One payment will be made to the new sales invoice and the second payment will be made and not applied to any invoice.

D. Error occurs.
	1. When an error occurs you can attempt to save a new receipt, but note in the memo that an error occurred and you are retrying in order to distinguish duplicates from attempting to create two receipts.
	2. If the errors can't be fixed by retrying revert to paper receipts.
