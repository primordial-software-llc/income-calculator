        NVR and UPS installed in network cabinet.
        Network cabinet is installed tight against shelf to act as a replacement support to preserve the existing space as much as possible.
        This system will be dedicated to outdoor cameras and connected to the internet.
        An additional NVR will be installed in the future dedicated to common areas inside the home
        that will not be connected to the internet.

        Air flow is limited in this space,
        but outside the closet doors is an HVAC vent
        and the ambient temperature is acceptable with the current equipment running constantly.

        TV Mounted with all wires hidden. The image is from an Annke CV800 4k dome camera.
        There is a lot of night time light in this area and it's causing issues at a distance.
        A turret style Annke 4k Color Night Vision camera might be appropriate for the night time light
        and long distances.

        Up close near the perimeter the image quality is excellent.
        I will likely move this camera to a low light area like the backyard or front entry and install

        Equipment can be hidden and the rooms original look and feel can be restored,
        by switching off camera input and closing closet.
