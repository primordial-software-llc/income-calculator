    <h1>8 Channel 4k PoE NVR Residential Installation</h1>
    <p>
        I Scope out a space that is suitable for electronic equipment meeting the below criteria:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Readily accessible
                <ul>
                    <li>2014 Readily Accessible NEC definition: Capable of being reached quickly for operation, renewal, or inspections without requiring those to whom ready access is requisite to actions such as to use tools, to climb over or remove obstacles, or to resort to portable ladders, and so forth.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Insulated with HVAC vent nearby</li>
            <li>Off the ground to mitigate flood risks</li>
            <li>Close to an existing power source with the ability to easily run a dedicated circuit if needed in the future</li>
            <li>Close to an existing low voltage raceway with room to add a new raceway if necessary</li>
            <li>Preserves the existing look and feel of the home office space.</li>
        </ul>
        The center of the home office closet flush with the wire shelf meets the criteria.
        The space is prepared by removing the center wire shelf support.

        Probing the wall reveals concrete behind the drywall.
        1/2" Tapcon concrete anchors are used instead of the provided wedge anchor.
        Both fastener types require a 1/2" pilot hole.
        The tapcon concrete anchor is more appropriate for the residential space, because it can easily be removed by anyone with a socket wrench.

        6TB is the maximum HD size supported by the NVR.

        Annke 4k NVR and Tripp Lite 500va UPS installed in 19" 6U network cabinet with 200lbs weight capacity.
        UPS is heavy at 20 lbs and only has supports for the front posts.
        A set of NavePoint rack mount server shelves are added providing support from all 4 posts.
        The rail shelves are installed upside down so the UPS can be screwed securely into to the rack.
        The network cabinet was installed directly below the shelf to act as a replacement support.
        This system has been connected to the internet and will be limited to outdoor cameras to limit privacy risks.

        50 amp generator transfer switch can deliver backup power to the UPS during prolonged power outages.

    <p>
        Air flow is limited in this space,
        but outside the closet doors is an HVAC vent.
        The ambient temperature is acceptable at 75 degrees fahrenheit with the current equipment running constantly.

        TV Mounted with all wires hidden. The image is from an Annke CV800 4k dome camera.
        There is a lot of night time light in this area and it's causing issues at a distance.
        This camera might be better placed in the backyard where it will not have to deal with varying levels of night time light at far distances.
        A turret style Annke 4k Color Night Vision camera might be more appropriate for the night time light
        and long distances.

        Up close near the homes perimeter the image quality is excellent even though the tv is only 1080p.
