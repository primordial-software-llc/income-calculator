This is where I sharpen my raw coding skills and stay technically sharp.

In this project I will strive for perfect 100 line classes.
A test for each production class.
Adhering to the three rules of TDD.

Right now I'm starting with dates.
I have a basic function and I'm going to see how far I can take it over the next few days.
I'm eventually going to try and break it as well pushing it beyond its limit.

For now though, I want to find some interesting things in the calendar.
The calendar is beginning to fascinate me with its complexity.
